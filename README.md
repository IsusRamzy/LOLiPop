# LOLiPop  
## Introduction
A new way to transfer memes that make you LOL (laugh out loud)  
The `iPop` juat doesn't mean anything.  

## How it Works
- You enter some elements to the meme using `lolimake.py`.
- The app converts them to a `list (meme)` of `dictionaries (elements)`.
- The app pickles the `encoded` meme to a file (when you save it).
- You send the generated file to someone.
- The receiver downloads the file.
- The receiver makes `loliread.py` read the file.
- The app reads the pickled meme.
- The app converts it to HTML (HyperText Markup Language).
- The app makes a file from the generated code.
- The app opens it with the default browser.
